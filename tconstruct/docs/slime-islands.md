# Slime islands (in progress)

The source definitions and island templates in `content/reference` are pinned
to TConstruct `f4e77d43f39ba1047bf93ae816b7e1beaab514c2`. The original
Overworld sky-island set has spacing 35, separation 4, frequency 0.5 and
weights 4:1 for sky slime and clay islands. Sea and Nether islands and End sky
islands use their own original structure sets and biome tags.

`source-slime-island-placement.rs` implements the original sea height and sky
height calculation, including the rotation-dependent offsets and the four
surface samples. It is tested as a standalone rule and is not connected to
world generation. The 20 original earth, sky, ender and blood island NBT
templates are retained without replacing vanilla structures.

The original uses `tconstruct:island`, not a vanilla jigsaw: its templates
include data markers that can place source slime trees, vines and grass. The
current Horizon structure registry recognizes the type as unsupported.
Tree/foliage registration, original drops and survival acquisition, marker
processing, worldgen integration, save/LAN and real-world validation remain
open. Sky/End slime mob spawn overrides also require their own entity support.
No island or slime-plant natural generation is claimed by this draft.
